- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    When we are wanting to use the React Life Cycle Methods. And also for using state and logic.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    Birth/Mounting - Constructor function is called and state data is initialized
    Growth/Updating - Any new props will trigger updates to the child and render will be ran again
    Death/Unmounting - Cleans up and destroys who was unmounted

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    They let us re-use our stateful logic and also for setting state and remembering that value we had set

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    So we know that our stuff is working. Like our components will get the info/data we know they should be getting.
